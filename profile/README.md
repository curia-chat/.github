# About the Project  
The project aims to advance research possibilities regarding judgments by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), powered by AI.  
To achieve this goal, the project consists of multiple repositories, each containing one necessary component:  

- **[curia-chat/collector](https://github.com/curia-chat/collector):**  
  A collection of scripts needed to collect ECJ judgments and write them to a database (currently, there is no publicly available uniform database of ECJ judgments).  
- **[curia-chat/frontend](https://github.com/curia-chat/frontend):**  
  Contains the frontend for interaction with the chatbot, which is currently powered by [Flowise](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise).  
- In future releases, there will be a repository containing the chatbot itself. The chatbot is currently provided via Flowise.

**The project is currently available in German only.**  
The project was started as a side project during the writing of the doctoral thesis by the current project owner.
